# Kaggle.com - Santa's Stolen Sleigh

I wanted to rewrite my [kaggle-santas-stolen-sleigh](https://github.com/codebender/kaggle-santas-stolen-sleigh)
repo in elixir as a learning exercise.

## ♫ Alarm bells ring, are you listening? Santa's sleigh has gone missing ♫

The North Pole is in an uproar over news that Santa's magic sleigh has been stolen. Able to carry all the world's presents in one trip, it was considered crucial to successfully delivering holiday goodies across the globe in one night.

Unwilling to cancel Christmas, Santa is determined to deliver toys to all the good girls and boys using his day-to-day, magic-less sleigh. With so little time to pull off this plan, Santa is once again counting on Kagglers to help.

Given the sleigh's antiquated, weight-limited specifications, your challenge is to optimize the routes and loads Santa will take to and from the North Pole. And don't forget about Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, and Vixen; Santa is adamant that the best solutions will minimize the toll of this hectic night on his reindeer friends.
